		<h2>What is my superpower</h2>
		<p>My super power is photographic memory. This superpower is awesome because I have the power to completely memorize anything I see in seconds. Although super photographic memory might sound a little boring, it is very useful! The ability to process and burn any information right into your brain within seconds can come very handy in a lot of situations. For example, is there a test where you forgot to study? Donâ€™t worry, forget studying! Just flip open your textbook and notes and quickly scan them, sit back and relax until the test, and then all the answers will be easily accessible right in your head! Does that not sound amazing? Here is another example. Forgot where you parked your car in heavy traffic? Scan through your head, find where you parked your car, and congrats! There will be no time wasted searching for your car!</p>
		<h2>How I got my superpower</h2>
		<p>TThis superpower was acquired when I was 10 years old. Back in 2011, there had been a horrible accident! Here is the story, I was walking down my good old neighbor hood and suddenly I heard the most mysterious sound. It was a crying sound coming from the sky. Then suddenly it falls 2 inches where I was about to step. Lying on the ground was an unusual object which said DO NOT OPEN. Being the smart one I am, I hesitantly opened it, and then I realized there was something odd about something inside that box. Suddenly an alien stood up and looked at me straight in the eyes. Then, the alien came up to me as I fearfully back away. As my heart was racing at about 300 beats a minute, the alien creature gently tapped me on my head. After that, what I perceived was mind blowing. My vision completely vanished, I could now see the unseen, things I cannot describe. When the experience was over, the object and alien were both gone. I tried to recall everything, but nothing appeared. I thought he swiped my memory but then I realized shortly after that I had the most amazing memory possible.</p>
		<h2>What I do with my power</h2>
		<p>I memorize things very quick, obviously. If I really wanted to abuse those powers, I could memorize someones credit card number and buy whatever I would like. But of course that is against the law. Something helpful that I could do is memorize criminals license plates. If there were to ever be a breaking of the law and there is escape in a vehicle, I will memorize that license plate and report to the police. If I were to be at a place where a murder has occurred, I can scan the murderer and an artist can draw out the face of the murderer. These are just some examples of things I could do!</p>
